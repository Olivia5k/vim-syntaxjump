# vim-syntaxjump

Improved mappings for `(` and `)` in programming languages where the `sentence`
motion doesn't make sense. The new mappings will jump to lines where the first
word is part of a predefined set of syntax groups (which can be configured per
filetype).

The functionality was inspired by `M-a` and `M-e` in That Other Editor.
