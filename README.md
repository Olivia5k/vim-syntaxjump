# vim-syntaxjump

Improved mappings for `(` and `)` in programming languages. The `sentence` text
motion makes a lot more sense for flowing text than for code. The new mappings
will jump to lines where the first word is part of a predefined set of syntax
groups (which can be configured per filetype).

The functionality was inspired by `M-a` and `M-e` in That Other Editor.
